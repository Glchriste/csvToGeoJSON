## csvToGeoJSON converter ##

This python script takes data in csv format and converts to geoJSON format for use in mapping applications on the web.

Two sample CSV documents, sample.csv and country_cap_latlon.csv, are included that can be used to show how the utility works. 

The script currently requires that CSV data be in the format specified in the sample data 'sample.csv', however, this could be easily adapted to fit other formats.
